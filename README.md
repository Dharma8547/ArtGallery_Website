#Skills Required:

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript
4. SQL
5. Hands on XAMPP.

#Scenario:

Here, first thing I need to conform to you everyone that I added the Ordering section unto where if you access this file and you know here Im using XAMPP for better connectivity and it helps us to create instance sql and everything. And already added the sql file, please check that. Here the user can see the arts and artist who painted that if any user found to be interested and he/she can make an order of that painting.
And not only that and if the user itself is an Artist he/she can upload the paintings to the gallery website with the permission.
And the admin can see all of the transactions and quesries, if anything happens he would modify too.

#Additional Info:
In sql file, I created in well-manner that each details will be secured in its respective tables with the help pf the XAMPP.
